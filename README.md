1. Introduction 
1.1 Squamous Cell Carcinoma Overview 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the 
skin. It starts in cells called squamous cells. The squamous cells make up the middle and outer 
layers of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer. 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. But if it's not treated, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. The 
growth of the cancer can cause serious complications. 
Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation. UV radiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps. Protecting 
your skin from UV light can help reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and 
other forms of skin cancer. 
Squamous cell carcinomas can be anywhere on the skin. In people who sunburn easily, the cancer 
is usually found on areas of skin that have had a lot of sun. In people with Black and brown skin, 
squamous cell carcinomas are more likely to be on skin that isn't exposed to sun, such as the 
genitals.

Challenges in Traditional Detection Methods 
Traditional object detection techniques, which rely heavily on handcrafted features and shallow 
trainable architectures, face several limitations and challenges in real-world applications. One 
significant limitation is their inability to efficiently handle complex and high-dimensional data, 
often resulting in a plateau in performance improvement [1]. Traditional methods such as sliding 
windows and region-based approaches are computationally inefficient, making them unsuitable 
for real-time applications where swift and accurate object identification is crucial [2]. These 
methods also struggle with occlusion, scale variations, and cluttered environments, which are 
common in real-world scenarios [2] [6]. Additionally, traditional techniques like background 
subtraction, optical flow, and frame differencing are less effective in dynamic and unpredictable 
environments, leading to inaccuracies in object detection and tracking [10]. The handcrafted 
features used in these methods are often not robust enough to handle the variability in object 
appearance and environmental conditions, such as adverse weather, which further degrades their 
performance [5]. Moreover, traditional object detection methods are not well-suited for tasks that 
require high-level semantic understanding, such as recognizing objects in crowded scenes or 
detecting small and partially occluded objects [1] [3]. The computational complexity of these 
methods also poses a challenge, as they require significant processing power and time, making 
them impractical for real-time applications without hardware acceleration [4]. Despite the use of 
hardware accelerators like GPUs and FPGAs, traditional methods still fall short in achieving the 
desired balance between accuracy and speed [2]. Furthermore, the lack of adaptability to different 
environmental conditions and the inability to generalize across various datasets limit the 
applicability of traditional object detection techniques in diverse real-world applications [8] [9]. 
The need for more advanced and efficient neural network models is evident, as traditional 
methods generate many feature maps to prevent occlusion, but this does not necessarily improve 
performance [6]. In summary, while traditional object detection techniques have laid the 
groundwork for the field, their limitations in handling complex, dynamic, and diverse real-world 
environments necessitate the development and adoption of more advanced deep learning-based 
methods to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in object detection tasks.

1.3  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) Overview 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are basically a type of algorithm designed to process data 
structured as graphs. In many industries, data is naturally represented as graphs. For example, 
social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn use graphs to store user profiles and 
their connections, enabling them to analyze relationships, recommend friends, and personalize 
content. E-commerce companies like Amazon and Netflix model user-item interactions in graphs 
to provide personalized recommendations. Similarly, companies like Google and Microsoft 
organize structured data through knowledge graphs, and financial institutions use graphs to detect 
fraudulent transactions by analyzing connections between users and suspicious activities.¶ 
GNNs work by processing nodes (entities like people or items) and their connections (edges) in 
a graph. Each node has features (e.g., a person’s age, interests) and interacts with neighboring 
nodes. GNNs learn by aggregating information from a node’s immediate neighbors, and then 
repeating the process across layers to gather information from more distant nodes. This way, 
GNNs understand complex relationships and make predictions, such as classifying individuals or 
predicting interests. Graphs can be directed, where connections flow in a specific direction (e.g., 
power or influence), or undirected, where relationships are bi-directional (e.g., mutual 
friendships). GNNs use a process called message passing, where nodes exchange and update 
information with their neighbors to refine their understanding of the graph.
